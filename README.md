# Lesson Manager

## What is Lesson Manager?
Lesson Manager is a helpful program for educators to help them organize activities, units, and standards. With the help of easy-to-use lesson manager, educators can easilt keep track of their units and the activities within them. Lesson manager gives educators a report on what standards they're not using in a particular unit, so that they know what else is needed to prepare students for an exam.

## How do I install it?
Unfortunately, Lesson Manager is a bit of a bulky application, and cannot be uploaded to GitHub. At the moment, the installation file is not available online. However, as Lesson Manager continues to be worked on and improved, the installation file will be made available at a later date. If you really want to try it out, you may follow the steps described in **How to Contribute**.

## How to Contribute
Lesson Manager is a new application, and there's still a lot to improve. You don't have to know how to code to contribute - just submitting/helping triage issues is very helpful. However, if you do want to contribute to the codebase (or install the program) just follow these steps (Windows only!):

1. Click the **Code** button on the main page of this GitHub repository
2. Click **"Download ZIP**
3. When the file finishes downloading, open the zip file
4. Inside the zip file, navigate to the folder that has the `program` folder
5. Extract the program folder to a new folder somewhere else
6. If you have Node.js installed, continue to the next step. If you do not have Node.js installed, follow the instructions at https://nodejs.org/en/download/
7. Open up a terminal inside the program folder
8. Run the command `npm i`
9. Once all dependencies are installed, you are ready to start coding!
10. When you want to test out a change, run `npm run dev`
11. When you want to build a production version, run `npm run electron-pack` (this will take a few minutes). You may install Lesson Manager with the provided setup executable.

Happy coding!
