# Lesson Manager

## What is Lesson Manager?
Lesson Manager is a helpful program for educators to help them organize activities, units, and standards. With the help of easy-to-use lesson manager, educators can easilt keep track of their units and the activities within them. Lesson manager gives educators a report on what standards they're not using in a particular unit, so that they know what else is needed to prepare students.

## How do I install it?
**Notes:**

 - *Lesson Manager is still in development, and there may be bugs in the program. If you encounter a bug, please submit a new issue on this repository's issue tracker.*
 - *Lesson Manager is a bit bulky, so you'll need about 400MB of space free to install it. We're working on making it lighter!*
